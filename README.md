WordPress Disclaimer Multisite Multilingual

This code will add a disclaimer message to the bottom of WordPress posts.  It’s designed for Multisite WordPress installations where you will need a different disclaimer message on each site. Such as alternative language translations for sites on a network.

It checks for a blogID number and if you’ve applied the block, it will match your text to the correct blog.

If no blogID is matched, then nothing is outputted into the posts.

To use this code, copy it to your themes functions.php file and modify as needed.
